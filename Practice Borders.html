    <p id="p2"> Making a classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich is simple yet satisfying. Start by selecting your favorite type of bread, whether it's white, whole wheat, or something heartier. Spread a generous layer of peanut butter on one slice, ensuring even coverage for a smooth, creamy texture. On the other slice, spread your choice of jelly or jam—grape and strawberry are traditional favorites, but there are plenty of delicious options to explore. Carefully press the two slices together, allowing the flavors to meld. For an extra twist, consider toasting the bread beforehand or adding slices of banana for added texture and sweetness.</p>
